## Unified Engagement Platform for Support, Sales & Renewal Teams

---

## 🧾 1. TL;DR

We're building a centralized **Support, Sales, and Renewal Engagement Platform** to unify multi-channel messaging (starting with Messaging), automate ticketing and renewals, enable scheduling, link every message to the correct POS outlet, and provide full CSAT and analytics dashboards — all within a scalable, role-based, PDPA-compliant system.

**Implementation note:** External messaging channel APIs are not integrated in the current app.

**Ticket creation (current):** Tickets are created and managed inside the app workflow.

**Current app scope:** The live repository implements an internal Next.js workspace with support tickets, merchant operations, ClickUp sync, sales leads, onboarding appointments, user management, public forms, and selected analytics pages. The sales lead module supports the full lead lifecycle — assignment, manual creation, editing, an Unworked/Worked status, per-lead deal tracking, and activity logging — plus a dedicated Deals page with List and Kanban (drag-and-drop stage) views.

**Current analytics note:** Not every dashboard in the app is backed by live metrics yet. The Renewal & Retention overview page is currently a preview-only screen with sample KPI values and placeholder chart content.

## 🛠 2. Problem Statement

Current workflows are fragmented: separate tools for messaging, ticketing, sales leads, onboarding scheduling, renewal management, and customer history. This causes:

* Slow first-response times and repeated manual tasks
* Lead leakage and inconsistent handoffs
* Poor visibility into account-level history
* Missed renewals and high churn risk
* No insight into support quality or ticket trends

We need a single, scalable platform for all merchant-facing teams.

---

## 🎯 3. Goals

### 🟢 Business Goals

* 40% reduction in manual workload
* First response time (FRT) under 5 minutes
* CSAT +20% within 2 months of launch
* 60% failed-renewal recovery rate
* 10% winback conversion for churned outlets
* Full analytics visibility (top ticket types, top merchants, agent performance)

### 👤 User Goals

* Agents: respond faster with full merchant context, canned replies, and auto-FID/OID mapping
* Sales: qualify leads, assign quickly, book onboarding
* Renewal: automate reminders, track payment recovery
* Ops: monitor CSAT, SLA breaches, ticket trends, and merchant-level activity

### ❌ Non-Goals

* Full CRM
* LLM auto-agent replies (MVP is human-in-the-loop only)

---

## 📦 4. Core Features (MoSCoW Prioritized)

### Current Release Snapshot

Implemented in the current app:

* Internal ticket creation and management in the app
* Merchant import and POS-backed merchant browsing
* ClickUp task creation/linking/status sync for tickets
* Sales lead capture and appointment scheduling
* Onboarding appointment workflows with MS PIC assignment before approval and email notifications for submission, approval, and completion
* User management, activation, password reset, and Google auth
* Public support and demo intake forms
* In-app knowledge base scaffolding
* Project Tracker — multi-project progress tracking for Product & Engineering, broken into phases and activities, with per-project Owner/Editor/Viewer access, finish-to-start dependencies and a dependency diagram, commenting with @mentions, email notifications, and ownership transfer
* Contacts directory (General) — a standalone merchant-side person with multiple phone numbers, mapped to either a specific outlet or an **entire franchise**, across any number of franchises. Phone/email duplicate detection blocks manual creation and offers the existing record; contacts are soft-deleted. An outlet's record on the merchant page lists contacts mapped directly to it plus contacts mapped to its whole franchise. A shared contact picker (`/api/contacts/search`) lets Sales, Renewal & Retention, and Merchant Success query the same directory; wiring a chosen contact into a Lead/Deal/Ticket/Invoice is scoped per consuming module and not yet built.
* Respond.io → SIMS ticket automation via n8n — an inbound endpoint (`POST /api/integrations/respond-io`, shared-secret authenticated, idempotent) that creates a ticket when a contact is tagged for Merchant Success, keeps `ms_pic_user_id` in sync with the Respond.io assignee, moves the ticket from Open to In Progress when an agent sends the first outgoing message, and resolves the ticket when the conversation closes. Contact-to-outlet resolution runs against the Contacts directory: one unambiguous outlet mapping auto-links the ticket, a franchise-wide mapping pre-fills the franchise and still asks the agent for the outlet, and anything else flags the ticket for manual linking. Managed from **General → Integrations** (routing tag, secret rotation, event log). The purpose-built `respondio_contact_outlets` table this originally specified was never built and has been dropped from the design.
* SIMS → Respond.io CSAT survey on close — closing a Respond.io-sourced ticket sends the merchant their CSAT link automatically, back into the conversation they already used, so an agent no longer has to remember the share button. Skipped when the link was already shared by hand, when the ticket has no Respond.io contact (support-form and manually created tickets keep the manual button), and where no webhook is configured. A failed send never blocks the close: the agent is told to share manually and the attempt is recorded in the ticket's audit trail. Runs through n8n (`n8n/sims-csat-link-send.json`) like the inbound events.

Partially implemented or still preview-only:

* Renewal analytics dashboards
* Some operational dashboards and KPI surfaces
* Knowledge base publishing workflow

Planned but not implemented in the current app:

* Messaging webhook ingestion and outbound messaging orchestration
* Automated renewal reminder delivery
* Full CSAT messaging flow defined in the target-state product
* Queue/worker-based background processing from the target architecture

### ✅ Must-Have

* MessagingProvider Messaging integration (webhooks, templates, media, rate limits)
* Unified Inbox with role-based access, threaded view, collision control
* Ticketing system linked to FID/OID (with fallback disambiguation)
* SLA timers (FRT ≤ 5 min), ticket categories, statuses, internal notes, outcomes
* Auto-send CSAT on resolution (1–5 rating + optional comment)
* Renewal system based on outlet.expiry_date with message cadence (D-14, D-7, D-1, D+3)
* POS sync (daily) to fetch franchise/outlet metadata + expiry
* RBAC for roles (agent, sales, renewal, admin)
* Analytics dashboard: CSAT, ticket volume, FRT, ART, top issues, top merchants
* Data export, retention policy, PDPA compliance (right to erasure, audit log)

### 🟡 Should-Have

* Auto-classify inbound messages as lead vs support
* Lead capture (Messaging prompt, manual entry)
* Onboarding scheduling (real-time calendar, ICS, reminders)
* Internal KB lookup + canned replies
* BM language support
* Secondary channels: Email and web forms

### 🟠 Could-Have

* SSO (Google/Microsoft/Okta)
* QA tools (scorecards, conversation review)
* Customer portal for merchants

### ❌ Won’t-Have

* CRM replacement
* AI-only agents

## 🔄 5. Functional Workflows

### Inbound Ticket Flow

1. Merchant sends Messaging message
2. Ingestor verifies + emits event → creates/updates ticket
3. FID/OID resolved via phone → POS lookup
4. SLA timer starts; agent assigned
5. Agent triages with canned replies, internal notes
6. On resolve → CSAT sent; ticket archived

### Sales Lead Flow

1. New contact → prompt for name, biz, interest
2. If lead → auto-create lead ticket, route to sales manager
3. Sales rep follows up; books onboarding
4. Onboarding calendar shared with Merchant Success team

### Renewal Flow

1. Daily sync pulls outlet.expiry_date
2. Scheduler computes due renewals (within 60d)
3. Messaging template reminders sent (D-14, D-7, D-1, D+3)
4. Status updated based on reply or POS API push
5. Recovery attempt logged (with cap on attempts)

### CSAT Flow

1. On ticket `Resolved` → send CSAT template
2. User taps 1–5; optional comment
3. Aggregated by ticket, agent, FID/OID; used in dashboards

**Google Review trigger.** After a CSAT submission, if the **Support Service** rating is
Satisfied or Very Satisfied (3–4), the survey surfaces a public Google Review link for Slurp
Retail Tech Sdn Bhd, encouraging happy customers to leave a public review. Neutral/Dissatisfied
(1–2) responses are routed away from public channels — no link is shown. The decision uses the
Support Service rating only; the Product rating is captured for analytics. Link "shown" and
"clicked" are tracked and reported as a shown → clicked → conversion-rate funnel in CSAT Insights.

---

## 📊 6. Analytics & Insights

* Ticket volume: total, by category, by agent, by merchant
* SLA performance: FRT, ART, backlog aging
* CSAT: score distribution, response rate, agent-specific
* High-touch merchants: outlets with 5+ tickets/month
* Export: CSV, scheduled email summary
* Reopen rate tracking (recurring issues)

## 🧠 8. Data Model (Key Tables)

* `ticket(fid, oid, contact_id, status, category, assigned_user, timestamps)`
* `contacts(name, email, role, source, respondio_contact_id, created_by_user_id, deleted_at)` ← the shared merchant-side person; soft-deleted, never hard-deleted
* `contact_phone_numbers(contact_id, phone, phone_normalized, is_primary)` ← one contact, many numbers; `phone_normalized` powers duplicate detection and Respond.io phone matching
* `contact_outlets(contact_id, franchise_id, outlet_id)` ← resolution table. `outlet_id IS NULL` means the contact represents **every** outlet under `franchise_id`
* `respondio_settings(routing_tag)` / `respondio_integration_secrets(key_id, secret_hash, …)` / `respondio_webhook_events(idempotency_key, processing_status, …)` ← the Respond.io bridge's config, keys, and idempotency ledger
* `csat_response(ticket_id, rating, comment, responded_at)`
* `renewal(fid, oid, due_date, status)` ← computed from `outlet.expiry_date`
* `renewal_attempt(renewal_id, channel, template, result)`
* `message(ticket_id, wa_message_id, content, media_sha256)`
* `user_scope(user_id, fid, oid)` ← RBAC scope
* `project(name, description, start_date, created_by_user_id)`
* `project_member(project_id, user_id, role)` ← Owner/Editor/Viewer, per-project access
* `project_item(project_id, parent_item_id, item_type, name, status, assigned_user_id, deleted_at)` ← phases and activities in one table
* `project_item_dependency(project_id, item_id, depends_on_item_id)` ← finish-to-start edges
* `project_item_comment(project_id, item_id, body, created_by_user_id)` ← mentions stored inline in `body`
